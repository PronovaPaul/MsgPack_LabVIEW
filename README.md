# MsgPack_Lab-VIEW
 
MsgPack_Lab-VIEW is a lightweight MessagePack serializer and deserializer library written in native LabVIEW 2016.

One can decode a MsgPack message to LabVIEW variant containing correct type, or - when type is known at compile time - one can use dedicated decode functions for each supported type.
